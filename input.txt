Forager General Skill
While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success.On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success.Each time your proficiency rank in Survival increases, double the number of additional creatures you can take care of on a success (to eight if you're an expert, 16 if you're a master, or 32 if you're legendary).You can choose to care for half the number of additional creatures and provide a comfortable living instead of subsistence living.Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat.

Manifest Eidolon Arcane Concentrate Conjuration Manipulate Summoner Teleportation
Your eidolon appears in an open space adjacent to you, and can then take a single action. If your eidolon was already manifested, you unmanifest it instead.The conduit that allows your eidolon to manifest is also a tether between you. Your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can't willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon's physical form dissolves: your eidolon unmanifests, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest it again.Special This activity has the trait matching your eidolon's tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).

Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Grabbed  GrabbedYou're held in place by another creature, giving you the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} conditions. If you attempt a manipulate action while grabbed, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
Immobilized  ImmobilizedYou can't use any action with the move trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.

Manifest Eidolon Arcane Concentrate Conjuration Manipulate Summoner Teleportation
Your eidolon appears in an open space adjacent to you, and can then take a single action. If your eidolon was already manifested, you unmanifest it instead.The conduit that allows your eidolon to manifest is also a tether between you. Your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can't willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon's physical form dissolves: your eidolon unmanifests, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest it again.Special This activity has the trait matching your eidolon's tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).

Augury Spell 2 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Divination Divine Prediction You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes:Weal The results will be good.Woe The results will be bad.Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad.Nothing There won't be particularly good or bad results.The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always "nothing." This makes it impossible to tell whether a "nothing" result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result. Components: MSV Cast Time: 10 minutes

Persistent Damage (4d4 fire)  Persistent Damage (4d4 fire)Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as "X persistent [type] damage," where "X" is the amount of damage dealt and "[type]" is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:15] check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Feather Token (Chest) 1/1 Charges Conjuration Consumable Magical
Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather's shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.Activate A InteractWhen you use this token, a small wooden chest appears and immediately opens. This chest can hold up to 10 Bulk worth of items. Once the chest is closed, it transforms again-this time into a key-taking all of the stored items with it. You can activate this key by spending an Interact action to turn it in an imaginary lock, which causes it to transform back into a chest with all of the items still inside. Once it has turned into a chest a second time, it forever remains a wooden chest.

Invisibility Sphere Spell 3 Manipulate Divine Illusion You and all targets are Invisible except to each other as long as you remain within the spell's area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell's area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell's area. If any creature made invisible by this spell uses a hostile action, the spell ends after the hostile action is completed.While exploring, it's easy to move together slowly and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until at most the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.Heightened (5th) The duration increases to 1 hour. Place 10-Foot Emanation

Stunned 1 StunnedYou've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

With two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1-2 on 1d6). With only one image, the chances are 1 in 2 (1-3 on 1d6).Once an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit your AC but doesn't critically fail, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and the attack roll becomes a success against you.

Quickened  QuickenedYou gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you've been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.
Stunned 1 StunnedYou've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Immobilized  ImmobilizedYou can't use any action with the move trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.
Frightened 1 FrightenedYou're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Blinded  BlindedYou can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a -4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled}.
Dying 2 DyingYou are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save.If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1} condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.
Flat-Footed  Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Prone  ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Tj055UcNm6UEgtCg]{Crawl} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.OdIUybJ3ddfL7wzj]{Stand}. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).If you would be knocked prone while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Flying}, you fall. You can't be knocked prone when @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swimming}.
Stupefied 1 StupefiedYour thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell attack rolls, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these ability scores. Any time you attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} while stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.
Unconscious  UnconsciousYou're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act. You take a -4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're in a position in which you wouldn't.If you're unconscious because you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying}, you can't wake up while you have 0 Hit Points. If you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.Someone shakes you awake with an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action.There's loud noise going on around you-though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.

During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes:Weal The results will be good.Woe The results will be bad.Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad.Nothing There won't be particularly good or bad results.The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always "nothing." This makes it impossible to tell whether a "nothing" result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result. Components: MSV Cast Time: 10 minutes

Stunned 2 StunnedYou've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Prone  ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Tj055UcNm6UEgtCg]{Crawl} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.OdIUybJ3ddfL7wzj]{Stand}. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).If you would be knocked prone while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Flying}, you fall. You can't be knocked prone when @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swimming}.
Stunned 2 StunnedYou've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Stunned You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Wounded 1 WoundedYou have been seriously injured. If you lose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition and do not already have the wounded condition, you become wounded 1. If you already have the wounded condition when you lose the dying condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1.

Stunned 2 StunnedYou've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.
Deafened  DeafenedYou can't hear. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to hear. You take a -2 status penalty to Perception checks for initiative and checks that involve sound but also rely on other senses. If you perform an action with the auditory trait, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost; attempt the check after spending the action but before any effects are applied. You are immune to auditory effects.

Seashell of Stolen Sound Spell 1 Concentrate Manipulate Divination Occult Sonic Trigger A creature within range begins to make a sound.You store a sound in a seashell to use as you will: the last words of a loved one, a dragon's mighty roar, the compromising conversation between two powerful diplomats, or even more strange and secret. As part of Casting this Spell, you must present an unbroken seashell. When you Cast the Spell, magic swirls around the triggering creature, copying the sounds they make, as well as any background noise, for the next minute and storing them in the seashell.You or another creature can then play the sound back from the seashell during the spell's duration by Interacting with the seashell, but once the sounds have been played back, the seashell shatters and the spell ends.As normal for spells with a duration until your next daily preparations, you can choose to continue expending the spell slot to prolong the duration of an existing seashell of stolen sound for another day. While the spell faithfully copies the sounds around the target, it doesn't reproduce any special auditory or sonic effects of the sound. Components: FV Range: 30 feet Cast Time: reaction Duration: until your next daily preparations

Feather Token (Fan) 1/1 Charges Conjuration Consumable Magical
Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather's shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.Activate A InteractActivating this feather requires you to fan it in a given direction. If this direction is toward the sail of a vessel, the feather flutters up toward the sail and fans continuously, filling the sail with air and granting the vessel a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for 8 hours. If fanned in any other direction, it instead produces a single casting of @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.g8QqHpv2CWDwmIm1]{Gust of Wind} (DC 20).

However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.Heightened (3rd) You learn the school of magic for the highest-level effect within range that the spell detects. If multiple effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn.Heightened (4th) As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-level magic.

Quickened  QuickenedYou gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you've been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.

Slowed 1 SlowedYou have fewer actions. Slowed always includes a value. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by your slowed value. Because slowed has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn.
Grabbed  GrabbedYou're held in place by another creature, giving you the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} conditions. If you attempt a manipulate action while grabbed, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
Flat-Footed  Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Immobilized  ImmobilizedYou can't use any action with the move trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.

[3/13/2023, 10:40:26 PM] Yue's status effects:
Blinded  BlindedYou can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a -4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled}.
Dying 2 DyingYou are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save.If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1} condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.
Flat-Footed  Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Frightened 1 FrightenedYou're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.
Prone  ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Tj055UcNm6UEgtCg]{Crawl} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.OdIUybJ3ddfL7wzj]{Stand}. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).If you would be knocked prone while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Flying}, you fall. You can't be knocked prone when @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swimming}.
Sickened 2 SickenedYou feel ill. Sickened always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on all your checks and DCs. You can't willingly ingest anything-including elixirs and potions-while sickened.You can spend a single action retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude save against the DC of the effect that made you sickened. On a success, you reduce your sickened value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success).
Slowed 1 SlowedYou have fewer actions. Slowed always includes a value. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by your slowed value. Because slowed has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately lose actions if you become slowed during your turn.
Unconscious  UnconsciousYou're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act. You take a -4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're in a position in which you wouldn't.If you're unconscious because you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying}, you can't wake up while you have 0 Hit Points. If you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.Someone shakes you awake with an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action.There's loud noise going on around you-though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.

You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount.

If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Prone  ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Tj055UcNm6UEgtCg]{Crawl} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.OdIUybJ3ddfL7wzj]{Stand}. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).If you would be knocked prone while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Flying}, you fall. You can't be knocked prone when @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swimming}.
Wounded 1 WoundedYou have been seriously injured. If you lose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition and do not already have the wounded condition, you become wounded 1. If you already have the wounded condition when you lose the dying condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1. If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase your dying condition value by your wounded value.The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

[3/14/2023, 12:11:28 AM] Dread Wraith's status effects:
Clumsy 2 ClumsyYour movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery.
Quickened  QuickenedYou gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you've been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.
Stunned 2 StunnedYou've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Restyle Spell 4 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Primal Transmutation You permanently change the appearance of one piece of clothing currently worn by you or an ally to better fit your aesthetic sensibilities. You can change its color, texture, pattern, and other minor parts of its design, but the changes can't alter the clothing's overall shape, size, or purpose. The changes can't increase the quality of the craftsmanship or artistry of the piece of clothing, but particularly gauche choices for the new color and pattern might decrease its aesthetic appeal. This spell transforms existing materials into the desired appearance and never alters the material or creates more material than what's originally part of the object. The object's statistics also remain unchanged.

Feather Token (Bird) Common Conjuration Consumable Magical
Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather's shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.Activate A InteractWhen activated, this token transforms into a small sparrow that waits on your finger for you to relay a message up to 1 minute in length, along with the name and rough location of a recipient. The recipient must be someone you have met, and the location must be somewhere you have visited. After receiving the message, the bird flies off to deliver it, traveling at 30 miles per hour and then searching for the target in the location you provided. If the bird finds the target, it moves adjacent to them, your words emanate from the bird, and the bird then flies off and vanishes. The bird also vanishes if it fails to find your target after 10 hours of searching the location you specified.

You can attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it and ends the spell.

Flat-Footed Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Restrained RestrainedYou're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned.

Flat-Footed Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Prone ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Tj055UcNm6UEgtCg]{Crawl} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.OdIUybJ3ddfL7wzj]{Stand}.

You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain flat-footed).If you would be knocked prone while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Flying}, you fall.

Wounded 1 Wounded 1You have been seriously injured. If you lose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition and do not already have the wounded condition, you become wounded 1. If you already have the wounded condition when you lose the dying condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1. If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase your dying condition value by your wounded value.The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.

The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all directions around it. There is no limit to how far from you the eye can move, but the spell ends immediately if you and the eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it and ends the spell.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Quickened QuickenedYou gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you've been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.
Frightened 1 Frightened 1You're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.
Dying 2 Dying 2You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save.If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1} condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.
Blinded BlindedYou can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a -4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled}.
Flat-Footed Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Prone ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls.

If you are restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.Someone shakes you awake with an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action.There's loud noise going on around you-though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.

Quickened QuickenedYou gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round. Many effects that make you quickened specify the types of actions you can use with this additional action. If you become quickened from multiple sources, you can use the extra action you've been granted for any single action allowed by any of the effects that made you quickened. Because quickened has its effect at the start of your turn, you don't immediately gain actions if you become quickened during your turn.
Frightened 1 Frightened 1You're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.
Dying 1 Dying 1You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save.If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded 1} condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.
Blinded BlindedYou can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail Perception checks that require you to be able to see, and if vision is your only precise sense, you take a -4 status penalty to Perception checks. You are immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled}.

Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything.

Persistent Damage (1d10 fire) Persistent Damage (1d10 fire)Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as "X persistent [type] damage," where "X" is the amount of damage dealt and "[type]" is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:15] check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.
Clumsy 1 Clumsy 1Your movements become clumsy and inexact. Clumsy always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to the condition value to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, including AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery.

Regenerate Spell 7 Concentrate Manipulate Healing Necromancy Positive An infusion of positive energy grants a creature continuous healing. The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns. While it has regeneration, the target can't die from damage and its Dying condition can't increase to a value that would kill it (this stops most creatures from going beyond dying 3), though if its Wounded value becomes 4 or higher, it stays Unconscious until its wounds are treated. If the target takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until after the end of its next turn. Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration, it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During the spell's duration, the creature can also reattach severed body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body part to the area it was severed from.Spell Effect: RegenerateHeightened (9th) The regeneration increases to 20.

Binding Vow Auditory Concentrate Enchantment Occult
Frequency once per dayEffect You bind yourself by formally speaking a binding vow. Supernatural power flows through and around you as you speak it, and all those present to hear it intrinsically know that it binds you. Breaking this vow is anathema to you, and if you break it willingly, you lose all pactbinder benefits until you fulfill your vow or, if that's impossible, participate in an atone ritual. The vow doesn't prevent unwilling violations and can't be used to try to circumvent mind-control magic, confusion, or similar situations where you perform an action not entirely of your own volition. A Binding Vow doesn't end until you've fulfilled it. Even if you die, the vow still binds you if you return to life. The vow doesn't force you to go to ridiculous extremes, such as dying, to fulfill your vow unless you specifically swear to go to such extremes. Trying to subvert your binding vow by making selfish promises (such as swearing to an ally that you'll kill someone you already wanted to kill) is in itself a violation of your vow, as is attempting to subvert other vows you've made (such as those from other pactbinder feats or a champion's code). When you make a Request or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd]{Coerce} directly in service of fulfilling your vow, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check against any creatures aware of your vow.

Shadow Walk Spell 5 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Conjuration Divine Shadow Teleportation You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together).

On a failure, the result is always "nothing." This makes it impossible to tell whether a "nothing" result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result. Components: MSV Cast Time: 10 minutes

When you Cast the Spell, magic swirls around the triggering creature, copying the sounds they make, as well as any background noise, for the next minute and storing them in the seashell.You or another creature can then play the sound back from the seashell during the spell's duration by Interacting with the seashell, but once the sounds have been played back, the seashell shatters and the spell ends.As normal for spells with a duration until your next daily preparations, you can choose to continue expending the spell slot to prolong the duration of an existing seashell of stolen sound for another day. While the spell faithfully copies the sounds around the target, it doesn't reproduce any special auditory or sonic effects of the sound.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

As part of Casting this Spell, you must present an unbroken seashell. When you Cast the Spell, magic swirls around the triggering creature, copying the sounds they make, as well as any background noise, for the next minute and storing them in the seashell.You or another creature can then play the sound back from the seashell during the spell's duration by Interacting with the seashell, but once the sounds have been played back, the seashell shatters and the spell ends.As normal for spells with a duration until your next daily preparations, you can choose to continue expending the spell slot to prolong the duration of an existing seashell of stolen sound for another day. While the spell faithfully copies the sounds around the target, it doesn't reproduce any special auditory or sonic effects of the sound.

Frightened 1 Frightened 1You're gripped by fear and struggle to control your nerves. The frightened condition always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.
Grabbed GrabbedYou're held in place by another creature, giving you the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} conditions. If you attempt a manipulate action while grabbed, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:5] check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
Flat-Footed Flat-FootedYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the flat-footed condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally flat-footed against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is flat-footed."
Immobilized ImmobilizedYou can't use any action with the move trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.

Shadow Walk Spell 5 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Conjuration Divine Shadow Teleportation You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together). Components: MSV Range: touch Targets: you and up to 9 willing creatures touched Cast Time: 1 minute Duration: 8 hours

You take a status penalty equal to this value to all your checks and DCs. Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your frightened condition decreases by 1.
Stunned 2 Stunned 2You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Influence Nature Downtime General Skill
With patience and time, you can make bird calls, leave game trails, and ultimately influence the behavior of a certain type of animals in the region to favor and even aid you in the days to come.The GM determines the DC of any check required and the amount of time your work requires (usually at least a day or two of downtime). While you can't directly control how you've influenced nature, you can hope for certain effects, such as easier hunts or birds falling silent whenever danger is approaching.If you're legendary in Nature, you can elicit these same adjustments to animal behavior in the area by spending only 10 minutes.

Drained 1 Drained 1When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you're hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you're a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.Each time you get a full night's rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points.
Off-Guard Off-GuardYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the off-guard condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally off-guard against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is off-guard."

Stunned 1 Stunned 1You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Stunned 2 Stunned 2You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Drained 1 Drained 1When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you're hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you're a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.Each time you get a full night's rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points.
Off-Guard Off-GuardYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the off-guard condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally off-guard against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is off-guard."
Persistent Damage (2d8 piercing) Persistent Damage (2d8 piercing)Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as "X persistent [type] damage," where "X" is the amount of damage dealt and "[type]" is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:15] check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.

For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Drained 1 Drained 1When a creature successfully drains you of blood or life force, you become less healthy. Drained always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to your drained value on Constitution-based checks, such as Fortitude saves. You also lose a number of Hit Points equal to your level (minimum 1) times the drained value, and your maximum Hit Points are reduced by the same amount. For example, if you're hit by an effect that inflicts drained 3 and you're a 3rd-level character, you lose 9 Hit Points and reduce your maximum Hit Points by 9. Losing these Hit Points doesn't count as taking damage.Each time you get a full night's rest, your drained value decreases by 1. This increases your maximum Hit Points, but you don't immediately recover the lost Hit Points.
Off-Guard Off-GuardYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the off-guard condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally off-guard against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is off-guard."
Persistent Damage (2d8 piercing) Persistent Damage (2d8 piercing)Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as "X persistent [type] damage," where "X" is the amount of damage dealt and "[type]" is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:15] check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.

The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

[9/12/2023, 12:03:45 AM] Lyra's status effects:
Off-Guard Off-GuardYou're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the off-guard condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others-especially conditions-can make you universally off-guard against everything. If a rule doesn't specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say "The target is off-guard."
Prone ProneYou're lying on the ground. You are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} and take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. The only move actions you can use while you're prone are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Tj055UcNm6UEgtCg]{Crawl} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OdIUybJ3ddfL7wzj]{Stand}. Standing up ends the prone condition. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} while prone to hunker down and gain cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain off-guard).If you would be knocked prone while you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climbing} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Flying}, you fall. You can't be knocked prone when @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx]{Swimming}.
Wounded 1 Wounded 1You have been seriously injured. If you lose the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition and do not already have the wounded condition, you become wounded 1. If you already have the wounded condition when you lose the dying condition, your wounded condition value increases by 1. If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase your dying condition value by your wounded value.The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1kGNdIIhuglAjIp9]{Treat Wounds}, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.
Stupefied 1 Stupefied 1Your thoughts and instincts are clouded. Stupefied always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks and DCs, including Will saving throws, spell attack rolls, spell DCs, and skill checks that use these ability scores. Any time you attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} while stupefied, the spell is disrupted unless you succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + your stupefied value.

Shadow Walk Spell 5 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Conjuration Divine Shadow Teleportation You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together). Components: MSV Range: touch Targets: you and up to 9 willing creatures touched Cast Time: 1 minute Duration: 8 hours

Stunned 2 Stunned 2You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Wall of Stone Spell 5 Concentrate Manipulate Arcane Conjuration Earth You shape a wall of solid stone. You create a 1-inch-thick wall of stone up to 120 feet long, and 20 feet high. You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 50 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be moved through, but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 15.

Stunned 1 Stunned 1You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. Stunned usually includes a value, which indicates how many total actions you lose, possibly over multiple turns, from being stunned. Each time you regain actions (such as at the start of your turn), reduce the number you regain by your stunned value, then reduce your stunned value by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned might also have a duration instead of a value, such as "stunned for 1 minute." In this case, you lose all your actions for the listed duration.Stunned overrides @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed}. If the duration of your stunned condition ends while you are slowed, you count the actions lost to the stunned condition toward those lost to being slowed. So, if you were stunned 1 and slowed 2 at the beginning of your turn, you would lose 1 action from stunned, and then lose only 1 additional action by being slowed, so you would still have 1 action remaining to use that turn.

Spiritual Weapon Spell 2 Concentrate Manipulate Divine Evocation Force A weapon made of pure magical force materializes and attacks foes you designate within range. This weapon has a ghostly appearance and manifests as a club, a dagger, or your deity's favored weapon.When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe you choose within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the weapon to a new target within range (if needed) and Strike with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.The weapon's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. You can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or traits of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual weapon is a weapon for purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.The weapon doesn't take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to it.Heightened (+2) The weapon's damage increases by 1d8. Attack MAP -5 MAP -10

Darkness Spell 4 Concentrate Manipulate Darkness Divine Evocation You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch or lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.Heightened (4th) Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness.

Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.Someone shakes you awake with an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F]{Interact} action.There's loud noise going on around you-though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DCs. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.

Other observers must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to realize you are passing a secret message, and they must critically succeed to understand the message itself.

As part of Casting this Spell, you must present an unbroken seashell. When you Cast the Spell, magic swirls around the triggering creature, copying the sounds they make, as well as any background noise, for the next minute and storing them in the seashell.You or another creature can then play the sound back from the seashell during the spell's duration by Interacting with the seashell, but once the sounds have been played back, the seashell shatters and the spell ends.As normal for spells with a duration until your next daily preparations, you can choose to continue expending the spell slot to prolong the duration of an existing seashell of stolen sound for another day. While the spell faithfully copies the sounds around the target, it doesn't reproduce any special auditory or sonic effects of the sound.

Illusory Creature Spell 2 Concentrate Manipulate Auditory Illusion Occult Olfactory Visual You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.Heightened (+1) The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).

Scroll of Comprehend Language (Level 2) Common Arcane Consumable Divine Magical Occult Scroll
@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.vTQvfYu2llKQedmY]Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions for that spell.To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack roll and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane, divine, occult, or primal).Any physical material components and costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when Casting a Spell from a scroll. You must replace any required material component for that spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.Note: To create a scroll or wand of a specific spell, drag the spell from the compendium or compendium browser into the inventory of a PC, NPC, or loot actor.

Shadow Walk Spell 5 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Conjuration Divine Shadow Teleportation You access the Shadow Plane, using its warped nature to spread your travels. The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can't see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane (although elements of that plane can sometimes be a hazy reflection of the Material Plane). While on the Shadow Plane, the targets are exposed to potential encounters with that plane's denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can Dismiss the spell's effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together and Dismiss the spell at the same point on the Plane of Shadow appear together). Components: MSV Range: touch Targets: you and up to 9 willing creatures touched Cast Time: 1 minute Duration: 8 hours

Prying Eye Spell 5 Exploration Concentrate Manipulate Divination Occult Scrying You create an Invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a location you can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions with your normal visual senses and continuously transmits what it sees to you. The first time you Sustain the Spell each round, you can either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all directions around it. There is no limit to how far from you the eye can move, but the spell ends immediately if you and the eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye destroys it and ends the spell.

This is the final release of the Pathfinder Second Edition system before changes from Pathfinder Player Core and Pathfinder GM Core are added. The majority of changes are simple renaming of some items, traits, and other elements, with some small tweaks to mechanics. Some of the coming non-renaming changes are more substantial:PC options: current Witch patron themes, Wizard arcane schools, and the Tiefling & Aasimar heritages are being moved to a "PF2e Legacy Data" module, which will be available soon.Alignment: alignment is being removed from all sheets, but the data will still exist on actors, hidden until a module enables the display of them as traits.Variant rules: the Dual Class and Ancestry Paragon variant rules are moving to the PF2e Workbench module. Other variants that were not reprinted, like Stamina, will be staying in the system as they are difficult to reproduce in module form.Premium modules: many adventure modules, such as those developed by Foundry Gaming and Sigil Services, keep up with system releases. This means updating the pf2e system version will be required to run such modules in the future.We will update our system wiki with a full list of changes prior to the 5.9 system release.

Fascinating Performance General Skill
When you Perform, compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you're trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour. If you're an expert in Performance, you can fascinate up to four observers; if you're a master, you can fascinate up to 10 observers; and if you're legendary, you can fascinate any number of observers at the same time.

On a critical failure, the weakness is 3 (in addition to the target being stunned 1). The weakness applies before daze deals damage.Amp Heightened (+2) The spell's damage increases by 2d10, and the weakness on a failure or critical failure increases by 1.

Recall the Teachings Divination Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Recall the Teachings Occult Psyche Psychic
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your next turn, you count as having prepared to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} all allies within 30 feet of you. If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an @Check[type:occultism|dc:20|traits:aid]{Occultism check} for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

Drop Dead R Spell 5 Divine Illusion Manipulate Visual Range 120 feet Targets 1 creature Duration sustained for up to 1 minuteTrigger A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns Invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd-for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage-the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.Heightened (7th) The spell doesn't end if the target uses hostile actions.

Magnetizing 1 Magical
Requirements A creature adjacent to you is made of metal or wearing metal armorEffect You magnetize your armor. If you or the target attempt to move away from one another, treat each square as difficult terrain. This doesn't affect movement that keeps you the same distance from one another, so you could still Step if you remained adjacent to the target. This effect ends once either of you is no longer adjacent to the other at the end of an action.This Activation might work on some creatures partially made of metal, such as those with metal scales, as determined by the GM. Likewise, the GM might determine some metal creatures are non-magnetic, depending on the metal they're made of.

Magnetizing 1 Magical
Requirements A creature adjacent to you is made of metal or wearing metal armorEffect You magnetize your armor. If you or the target attempt to move away from one another, treat each square as difficult terrain. This doesn't affect movement that keeps you the same distance from one another, so you could still Step if you remained adjacent to the target. This effect ends once either of you is no longer adjacent to the other at the end of an action.This Activation might work on some creatures partially made of metal, such as those with metal scales, as determined by the GM. Likewise, the GM might determine some metal creatures are non-magnetic, depending on the metal they're made of.

Drop Dead R Spell 5 Divine Illusion Manipulate Visual Range 120 feet Targets 1 creature Duration sustained for up to 1 minuteTrigger A creature within range is hit by an attack from an enemy.The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns Invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with a believable fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target's death seems absurd-for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage-the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target uses hostile actions, the spell ends. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.Heightened (7th) The spell doesn't end if the target uses hostile actions.

Augury Spell 2 Arcane Concentrate Exploration Manipulate Prediction Cast 10 minutes You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveal the GM's best guess among the following outcomes: good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good and bad), and nothing (there won't be particularly good or bad results).The GM rolls a secret DC 6 Flat Check. On a failure, the result is always "nothing." This makes it impossible to tell whether a "nothing" result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result.

Your mastery at surviving in the wild has given you a sort of sixth-sense when it comes to noticing creatures that aren't part of the natural order. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all initiative checks made at the start of a battle in which at least one of your enemies is an aberration, fey, mutant, or undead, or if one of your enemies is from a plane other than the Material Plane, as long as the battle takes place in a wilderness region. In wilderness regions, you also increase your Perception DC by 1 against these types of creatures for the purposes of resolving their Stealth checks. If you're master in Survival, this circumstance bonus increases to +2.If you know the Commune ritual, you can use Survival as a primary or secondary check to resolve that ritual-if you do so, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus.

You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed until the end of your turn. You then Stride twice.

You can choose to instead teleport to a space within your line of sight and line of effect with a range equal to double your Speed (after applying the status bonus from warp step).

The targeted objects fly to your location, letting you catch them easily in your hands, or dropping to the ground at your position, at your discretion. Unattended objects fly to you automatically. If you target secured objects or those in another creature's possession (such as sheathed weapons), you must attempt to Disarm the creature of the metal objects, making a spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to do so.Instead of drawing the objects to yourself, you can polarize a single metal object within range, designating it as a lodestone and causing the metal objects to fly to it instead. The lodestone must be at least three times the total Bulk of the targeted metal objects. Objects will stick to the lodestone for 1 minute, though they can be wrenched away with an Interact action.
